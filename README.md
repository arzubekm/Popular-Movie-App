# Popular-Movie-App
This is an android app which I made from Android Developer Udacity program.
# Features
It is still ongoing project, but so far you can:
* Discover the most popular, or the hightest rated movies
* Read summary about certain movie

# Source
The app was built using [TheMoviedb.org] (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to extract movies. One has to provide his own key to build the app.
